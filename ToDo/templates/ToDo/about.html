        Get ready to manage your tasks the way you want! Regular ToDoList is a fairly simple todolist app.
        It has all the basic features a todo app should have like creating and managing your tasks. Users also get a personal profile
        page where they can update their info like username or profile picture.
        <br>
        Since this is a web app, you can have your tasks available on all your devices once you login using your credentials. The app has military grade security
        built right into Django. Many new features should be arriving over the span of months:
